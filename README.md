# Travel-Booking-System

Console App



DESCRIPTION

-----------

Academic Project from Spring Quarter 2018, CSCD 349 - Design Patterns
Collaborative app with Tony Kolstee. 


HOW TO RUN

----------

Project created in IntelliJ. 
* App can be launched from path, "Travel Booking System - Console App/src/UserInterface/UI.java".
* Main entry point at "UI.java". 
* During program launch, select menu option, "1: Work with Airline System".
* In AIR System Menu; if you want to load a premade trip manifest, select option, "1: Read input file" and when prompted to "Enter File Name", use, "AMSin.txt" or "altAMSin.txt" to load data.



KNOWN BUGS

----------

No known bugs



NON-FUNCTIONING FEATURES

------------------------

* Rail and Cruise Ship system not fully implemented
* Not all Admin features enabled



PLANNED DESIGN UPDATES

----------------------

* If file, "AMSin.txt" is read in and then a duplicate airline or port entered causes intended error messages to display. I need to make it so that duplicated entries are just ignored. Error messages look too negative for user experience.
* Would love to convert this to a GUI app, might do in a future course or on free time as a challenge.
